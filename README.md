# System Behaviors and Complexity Measures of FitzHugh-Nagumo Oscillators 
**Overview**  
The investigation of synchronized behavour of neural activity lays the foundation for predicting human epileptic seizures. The objectives of this project are to study the synchronization of two bidirectionally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators and investigate chaotic system behaviours by performing complexity measures using a Rosenstein's algorithm and Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm.
